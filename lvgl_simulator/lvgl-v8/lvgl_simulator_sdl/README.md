# Simulator project for LVGL embedded GUI Library

The [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl) is written mainly for microcontrollers and embedded systems however you can run the library **on your PC** as well without any embedded hardware. The code written on PC can be simply copied when your are using an embedded system.

Using a PC simulator instead of an embedded hardware has several advantages:
* **Costs $0** because you you don't have to buy or design PCB
* **Fast** because you don't have to design and manufacture PCB
* **Collaborative** because any number of developers can work in the same environment
* **Developer friendly** because much easier and faster to debug on PC

* **SDL** a low level driver library to use graphics, handle mouse, keyboard etc.


```
base code:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lvgl/lv_sim_vscode_sdl
```

```

simulator updates less frequently than lvgl base code
in this assembly examples and main code are taken versions
lvgl 8.1.1
simple replacement of directories

also changed Makefile,
for ease of adding new files

```

### Install SDL
You can download SDL from https://www.libsdl.org/

On on Linux you can install it via terminal:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libsdl2-dev
```

### Setup
To allow custom UI code an `lv_conf.h` file placed at `ui/simulator/inc` will automatically override this projects lv_conf.h file. By default code under `ui` is ignored so you can reuse this repository for multiple projects. You will need to place a call from `main.c` to your UI's entry function.

To build and debug, press F5. You should now have your UI displayed in a new window and can access all the debug features of VSCode through GDB.

To allow temporary modification between simulator and device code, a SIMULATOR=1 define is added globally.
